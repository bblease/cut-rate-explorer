# Cut Rate Explorer
ðŸŽ®Play as a desperate explorer searching for water, food, and a toilet - a small game jam game written in Unity 3D

An old game I put together in 2017, but still something I wanted to show off as a sample of my Unity tinkering

You play as a crappy explorer who keeps running out of supply. Luckily there's always just what he needs on the other side of a chasm. You need to create the path he needs in the least amount of steps.

The controls are simple:
- Click the space bar to freeze the current randomizing path
- Green blocks put you forward 2 steps
- Red blocks put you back 1 step
- Picking up the mask in the last level burdens you

This was much more of a design focused effort, and was written in 1 month, as part of the game jam.
