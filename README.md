### ðŸŽ® Play as a desperate explorer searching for water, food, and a toilet - a small game jam game written in Unity 3D

An old game I put together in 2017, but still something I wanted to show off as a sample of my Unity tinkering

You play as a crappy explorer who keeps running out of supply. Luckily there's always just what he needs on the other side of a chasm. You need to create the path he needs in the least amount of steps.

The controls are simple:
- Click the space bar to freeze the current randomizing path
- Green blocks put you forward 2 steps
- Red blocks put you back 1 step
- Picking up the mask in the last level burdens you

This was much more of a design focused effort, and was written in 1 month, as part of the game jam.

Level 1 - a thirsty explorer needs a drink

Textures were painted and edited in GIMP, because it's free

Level 2 - your explorer is hungry. Luckily there's a feast of the dead just over there.

Models were created in Blender 3D. The low poly look was easy to make, but tricky to integrate into the background with fading textures on 3D boxes

Level 3 - you're about to be wracked with massive diarrhea, but that mask looks tempting.
